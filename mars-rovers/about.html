        <h3>Why does NASA send rovers to Mars?</h3>
        <p>
          NASA sends rovers to Mars to learn more about the planet’s history, geology,
          climate, and potential for life. Rovers can move across the surface, perform
          experiments, and send detailed data and images back to Earth.

      <section class="faq">
        <h3>How do rovers communicate with Earth?</h3>
        <p>
          Rovers usually send data to orbiters around Mars first. Those orbiters then
          relay the information back to large radio antennas on Earth. This process
          allows scientists and engineers to receive data and send new commands.

      <section class="faq">
        <h3>How long do Mars rover missions last?</h3>
        <p>
          Each mission has a planned length, but many rovers operate much longer than
          expected. For example, Opportunity was planned for about 90 days but
          continued exploring for nearly 15 years.

      <section class="faq">
        <h3>What are some key discoveries from the rovers?</h3>
        <p>
          Mars rovers have found rocks and minerals that form in water, evidence of
          ancient streambeds and lakes, and signs that Mars once had conditions that
          could have supported microbial life.

        <h3>Where can I learn more?</h3>
        <p>
          You can explore more images, videos, and mission updates on NASA’s official
          sites, such as the
