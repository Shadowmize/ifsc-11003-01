      <h2>Mission History</h2>
      <p>
        NASA’s Mars rovers are launched from Earth on powerful rockets and travel
        millions of kilometers through space before arriving at Mars. Each rover’s
        mission has a unique landing site and scientific focus.

        <h3>Spirit &amp; Opportunity</h3>
        <p><strong>Launch:</strong> 2003 (separate launches for each rover)</p>
        <p><strong>Landing:</strong> January 2004, different locations on Mars</p>
        <p>
          Spirit landed in Gusev Crater and Opportunity landed on the opposite side of
          Mars in Meridiani Planum. Their missions were designed to last about 90
          Martian days (sols), but both rovers far outlived their planned lifetimes.
        </p>
        <p>
          They found strong evidence that Mars once had liquid water, such as rocks
          that formed in water and signs of past wet environments.

      <section class="mission">
        <h3>Curiosity</h3>
        <p><strong>Launch:</strong> November 2011</p>
        <p><strong>Landing:</strong> August 2012 in Gale Crater</p>
        <p>
          Curiosity used a dramatic “sky crane” landing system to touch down safely in
          Gale Crater. This site was chosen because it has layers of rock that record
          Mars’s environmental history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, Curiosity has climbed the lower slopes of Mount Sharp, studying
          rock layers that show how Mars changed from a wetter world to the cold, dry
          planet we see today.

      <section class="mission">
        <h3>Perseverance</h3>
        <p><strong>Launch:</strong> July 2020</p>
        <p><strong>Landing:</strong> February 2021 in Jezero Crater</p>
        <p>
          Perseverance used a sky crane system, landing in Jezero Crater, which is
          believed to be an ancient lakebed with an old river delta. This makes it a
          prime location to search for signs of past microbial life.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to its scientific tools, Perseverance carries instruments to test
          new technologies, such as making oxygen from the Martian atmosphere and
          studying how future astronauts might use local resources.
