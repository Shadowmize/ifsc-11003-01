      <h2>Welcome to the Mars Rover Program</h2>
      <p>
        NASA’s Mars Rover Program sends robotic explorers to the surface of Mars to study
        its rocks, soil, atmosphere, and climate. These rovers are mobile science labs
        that help scientists investigate whether Mars could have once supported life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, rovers such as <strong>Spirit</strong>, <strong>Opportunity</strong>,
        <strong>Curiosity</strong>, and <strong>Perseverance</strong> have traveled across
        the Martian surface, capturing images, drilling into rocks, and sending data back
        to Earth.

          <h3>Curiosity</h3>
          <p>
            Curiosity landed on Mars in 2012. Its main mission is to determine if Mars ever
            had the right environmental conditions to support microbial life. It studies
            rocks and soil, and analyzes the chemistry of the Martian surface.

          <h3>Perseverance</h3>
          <p>
            Perseverance landed in 2021 inside Jezero Crater. It searches for signs of
            ancient life and collects rock samples that could be brought back to Earth in
            future missions. It also tests new technologies for future human exploration.

          <h3>Spirit &amp; Opportunity</h3>
          <p>
            The twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity landed on Mars in 2004. They were
            originally planned for 90-day missions but lasted for years. They helped prove
            that liquid water once flowed on the surface of Mars.
