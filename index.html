  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>
    Progressive enhancement is the practive of building a website in which that 
     core content is presentable for all users. After the core content is available 
     and presentable then you add advanced features. 
     This is super important because people using the website use all diffrent kinds of things 
     like computers or there phone or say an ipad and using this approach allows even people with
     slow internet to view the core functions or information on the website without having to use the advanced
     parts

  <h2>Reflection and Feedback</h2>
  <p>
    To start with the feedback I recieved from a family member it was my grandmother which she didnt give the greatest feedback since 
    shes not very tech savy but she did give some feedback like how if the user was on there phone they might have a harder time reading it in direct sunlight with how dark 
    my design is but in this case I just really like the way it looks so I didnt want to change it. On the Reflection side instead of how iv grown in this class from the begining of this semester
    id like the start at the begining of last semester since I failed the class last semester from my laziness, which I can say iv had some pretty strong growth in this area since iv actually done the work in the class
    this time around but another thing is I think this time around I had a much easier time grasping the concepts im not sure  why it could just be because at this point iv seen everything twice. 
    Something I would do diffrently if I had to do this a third time (please anything but that) I would try harder to make it to the actual meets to ask questions instead of just catching the recording at a later date.
    Another thing is that might sound cringe is I really like classes that at the end of you have a project instead of a test that allows you to use the skills you have accumulated over the course of the semester.
